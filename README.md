# What
Replacement logic board and firmware for Micro$oft's Sculpt keyboard

# Why
I really quite like M$'s line of ergonomic keyboards, most recently the Sculpt. Unlike the previous models I've enjoyed, the Sculpt has only a wireless model. While very slick, I'm somewhat concerned about the recent [MouseJack](https://www.mousejack.com/) revelations. From what I've read, my typed data should still be (reasonably) secure, but M$ has yet to announce updated FW for the USB dongle which could allow anyone in range to inject malicious HID packets to my machine. Maybe it's simply impossible to update the FW on the dongle?

# How
To "resolve" this security issue, this project will produce a logic board and firmware to convert the Sculpt to a normal USB keyboard. Currently, I only plan to convert the main keybaord and ignore the floating 10-key device, and I neither have nor care about the associated mouse.

# When
There's no particular time-scale for this project, except that I am already using the Sculpt in it's original state: I'm hoping to develop this board and working firmware before one of my colleages manages to take over my PC with an SDR or something. ;-)
